EasterCalcsTcl
==============

Tcl/Tk script to calculate the date of Easter according to the Julian, Gregorian, and Revised Julian (or MilankoviÄ‡) calendars for any given year.

Stand-alone executables (Starkits) are provided for Windows and Linux in the `bin` directory.

The Tcl/Tk script can be run directly, by changing directory to the `CalcEaster.vfs` directory, and executing `tclsh main.tcl` . This method presumes, of course, that Tcl/Tk has been installed on your operating system.
